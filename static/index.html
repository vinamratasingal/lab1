		Hello World! I'm a sophomore at Stanford University studying Computer Science. I am passionate about using technology and entrepreneurship to solve key problems in economic development, education, and politics. In the summer of 2013, I interned for <a href="http://www.paypal.com"> PayPal Inc, </a> on the Payments Customer Engineering Team. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, especially road trips, going to concerts, eating fancy food, reading, writing, and sleeping. My wildest dream would be to become a professional DJ and go around the world and headline at the Ultra Festival in Miami.  I hope you enjoy all the projects that I have done! </p>

			<div class="span7"> <h4> Dormy was inspired by my desire to connect with my future classmates in the Class of 2016. Eager to know where my friends were living, I decided to build a website that would help me discover where all my friends were. So, I built a tool that allowed them to add themselves to a dorm (after authenticating they went to Stanford through their email) and see who else was living in their dorm, and search across dorms. It also helped
			me learn web development through Ruby on Rails, as well as learning how to manage both the frontend and backend of a website.I also did this project through Bloc, through which I took a web development course. Through Dormy, I began my journey as a 
			computer programmer and fell in love with building things. </h4> </div> </div>

			<div class="span7"> <h4> GiftForward is my first social venture. Essentially, we're creating a new socially responsible gift card in which consumers are allowed to use the card to shop at any partnering retailer, and a percentage of all revenue from the gift card sales are invested in microfinance. I designed and created the signup page using Launchrock, and implemented a lot of social media and Google Analytics feature. It's super cool to be able to work on a project that has the potential to impact the lives of millions of people; I'm excited to see where it's heading! </h4> </div> </div>
